# Portfolio website

This is my personal portfolio website. 

The goal behind coding this was to have a space where I can share everything I do in a cool way.

## Technologies

The whole project is coded with a combination of ``HTML``, ``TailwindCSS``, ``GSAP`` and ``VueJS``. ``Nuxt`` was used in order to prerender the website and in consequence increase the SEO.
